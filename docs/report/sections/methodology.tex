\section{Methodology}
In order to solve the issue previously mentioned through the use of knowledge graphs, the differences of the information contained among different open data platforms will be assessed and a way to complete the information between sources will be studied and tried.  

Three different sources will be used in this project. MusicBrainz, the music database, will be the main source of the information whereas DBpedia and Wikidata will be used to analyse the differences and complete the information of the original information.  

Therefore, the project will be divided in two different phases: firstly, the knowledge graph will be generated from the database information and, secondly, different ways to interlink and complete the data will be analysed and used in order improve the original information.
