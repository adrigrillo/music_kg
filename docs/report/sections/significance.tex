\section{Significance}
As a passionate fan of alternative music and, specially, of small groups of my country, it can be seen how these inconsistencies usually occurs among the different platforms, leading to incorrect results or non-related recommendations.
Problems like these can generate frustration between the users, reducing the chances of the artists to being discovered. 

Generally, most of the inconsistencies are found in alternative artists that do not have the resources to fix this situation by themselves, therefore, any help this kind of groups can receive is extremely valuable for them as it increases the probability of reaching a broader audience.  

Moreover, as a defender of open data and crowdsourced information, I believe that any project that can help or give ideas on how to improve the quality of the data are extremely important nowadays. 
Specially if it is focused in the consolidation of the data in order to make the information reliable and improve the perception of this platforms as a trustworthy source.
